# Aygaz-Deep-Learning
This is a my deep learning project that i have developped during the Aygaz Deep Learning Bootcamp. 
I have built a CNN model that predicts a dogg's breed. But my accuracy was 0.06, which was not great. 
As you can see at table at the bottom of my project, accuracy did not change a lot and val_loss was deacreasing 
very little as the epochs passed.

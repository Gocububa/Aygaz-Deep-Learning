# Aygaz-Deep-Learning
There are two files as you can see. One of them (Aygaz Nöronlarıı) is the project that me and my team
have developed together and the other one (Untitled1) is the project i have personally developed myself during
the Aygaz Deep Learning Bootcamp. During this bootcamp, we were asked to build a CNN model that predicts a dog's breed
accurately.
At the group project file, you can see the accuracy was 0.09 and the loss was 4.3.
At my project file, the accuracy was 0.06, which was not great. 
As you can see at table at the bottom of my project, val_loss was deacreasing 
very little as the epochs passed.
